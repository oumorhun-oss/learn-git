Talking with my lawyer
She said, "Where'd you find this guy?"
I said, "Young people fall in love
With the wrong people sometimes"

Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love
When you're really just in pain
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end, it's better for me
That's the moral of the story, babe
